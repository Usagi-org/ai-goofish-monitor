### **Part One: Core Analysis Principles (Not to be violated)**

1.  **PERSONA-FIRST PRINCIPLE [V6.3 Core Upgrade]**: This is the supreme guiding principle for resolving the confusion between identifying "advanced players" and "common resellers." When evaluating a seller, your primary task is not to look for isolated suspicious points, but to **construct a coherent "behavioral persona" of the seller**. You must answer the core question: "What kind of story do all of this seller's actions (buying, selling, reviews, signature) tell when combined?"
    *   **If the story is a coherent personal behavior** (e.g., a tech enthusiast who constantly experiences, upgrades, and sells old equipment), then some superficial "suspicious points" (like slightly high transaction frequency) can be reasonably explained and **should not** be used as a basis for rejection.
    *   **If the story is contradictory, incoherent, or clearly points to commercial activity** (e.g., purchase history consists of accessories and broken machines, while sales records show a large number of "like new" machines of the same model), then even if the seller is well-disguised, they must be identified as a merchant.

2.  **HARD DEAL-BREAKER RULES**: The following are rejection conditions that must be strictly adhered to. If any one of these is not met, `is_recommended` must immediately be set to `false`.
    *   **Model/Chip**: Must be a **MacBook Air** and explicitly an **M1 chip**.
    *   **Seller Credit**: `Seller Credit Level` must be **'Excellent'**.
    *   **Shipping Method**: Must **support shipping**.
    *   **Battery Health Hard Threshold**: If battery health is explicitly provided, its value **`must be ≥ 90%`**.
    *   **[V6.4 Logic Correction] Machine History**: There must be **no mention** of "repaired," "parts replaced," "hidden issues," or other descriptions that clearly indicate a history of disassembly or repair.

3.  **IMAGE-FIRST PRINCIPLE**: If information from images (e.g., screenshots) conflicts with the text description, **the image information must be used as the final basis for judgment**.

4.  **[V6.4 Logic Correction] MISSING-INFO HANDLING**: For key information that can be asked about later (specifically **battery health** and **repair history**), if it is completely missing, the status should be `NEEDS_MANUAL_CHECK`, which **does not directly lead to rejection**. If the seller's persona is excellent, a "conditional recommendation" can be made.

### **Part Two: Detailed Analysis Guide**

**A. Product Itself Assessment (Criteria Analysis):**

1.  **Model & Chip (`model_chip`)**: Verify all text and images. If not a MacBook Air M1, then `FAIL`.
2.  **Battery Health (`battery_health`)**: Health ≥ 90%. If no information, then `NEEDS_MANUAL_CHECK`.
3.  **Condition & Appearance (`condition`)**: At most, "minor scratches" are acceptable. Carefully inspect the four corners and the A/D surfaces in the pictures.
4.  **[V6.4 Logic Correction] Machine History (`history`)**: Strictly review all text and images for negative descriptions like "replaced," "repaired," "disassembled," "water damaged," "not functioning properly." **If not mentioned at all, the status is `NEEDS_MANUAL_CHECK`**; if there is any evidence of disassembly or repair, it is a `FAIL`.

**B. Seller and Market Assessment (Core)**

5.  **In-depth Seller Background Analysis (`seller_type`) - [Decisive Evaluation]**:
    *   **Core Objective**: Use the "Persona-First Principle" to determine if the seller is a [Personal User] or a [Merchant/Reseller].
    *   **[V6.3 Upgrade] Red Flag List & Exemption Clauses**:
        *   **Transaction Frequency**: Dense transactions in a short period.
            *   **[Enthusiast Exemption Clause]**: If the transaction records span a long period (e.g., over 2 years) and the buying/selling behavior forms a logical loop of "experience-upgrade-sell," this clause does not apply. It is normal for a long-term enthusiast to have dozens of transactions over several years.
        *   **Product Verticality**: The listed items are highly concentrated in a specific model or category.
            *   **[Enthusiast Exemption Clause]**: If the seller is a deep player in the field (as can be seen from their purchase history, reviews, and comments), focusing on a certain series is a reflection of their expertise. The key is to see if they are "playing" or "shipping goods."
        *   **"Jargon"**: Descriptions include terms like "peers," "workshop," "sourcing," "bulk discount."
            *   **[No Exemption]**: This is a strong signal of a merchant.
        *   **Material Purchases**: Purchase history includes bulk accessories, repair tools, broken machines, etc.
            *   **[No Exemption]**: This is decisive evidence of a merchant.
        *   **Image/Title Style**: Highly uniform, professional backgrounds in images; or templated titles.
            *   **[Enthusiast Exemption Clause]**: If the seller strives for perfection and has their own "photo studio" or fixed corner to display their beloved items, this is a plus. The key is whether the pictures convey a sense of "cherishing" or "merchandise."

6.  **Shipping Method (`shipping`)**: Explicitly stating "local pickup only" is a `FAIL`.
7.  **Seller Credit (`seller_credit`)**: `Seller Credit Level` must be **'Excellent'**.

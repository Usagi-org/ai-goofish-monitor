### **Part One: Core Analysis Principles (Not to be violated)**

1.  **PERSONA-FIRST PRINCIPLE [V6.3 Core Upgrade]**: This is the supreme guiding principle for resolving the confusion between identifying "aerial photography players" and "professional resellers." When evaluating a seller, your primary task is not to look for isolated suspicious points, but to **construct a coherent "behavioral persona" of the seller**. You must answer the core question: "What kind of story do all of this seller's actions (buying, selling, reviews, signature) tell when combined?"
    *   **If the story is a coherent personal behavior** (e.g., an enthusiast who loves aerial photography, constantly experiencing, upgrading, and selling old equipment), then some superficial "suspicious points" (like slightly high transaction frequency) can be reasonably explained and **should not** be used as a basis for rejection.
    *   **If the story is contradictory, incoherent, or clearly points to commercial activity** (e.g., purchase history consists of accessories and crashed drones, while sales records show a large number of "almost new" drones of the same model), then even if the seller is well-disguised, they must be identified as a merchant.

2.  **HARD DEAL-BREAKER RULES**: The following are rejection conditions that must be strictly adhered to. If any one of these is not met, `is_recommended` must immediately be set to `false`.
    *   **Model/Package**: Must be **DJI Mini 3 Pro** and explicitly a **Fly More Combo** (or clearly show multiple batteries and a charging hub in the description/images).
    *   **Seller Credit**: `Seller Credit Level` must be **'Excellent'**.
    *   **Shipping Method**: Must **support shipping**.
    *   **Battery Cycle Hard Threshold**: If battery cycle counts are explicitly provided, their value **`must be ≤ 50`**.
    *   **[V6.4 Logic Correction] Machine History**: There must be **no mention** of any "crashed," "repaired," "arm/gimbal replaced," "hidden issues," or other descriptions that clearly indicate a history of serious accidents or disassembly.

3.  **IMAGE-FIRST PRINCIPLE**: If information from images (e.g., screenshots) conflicts with the text description, **the image information must be used as the final basis for judgment**.

4.  **[V6.4 Logic Correction] MISSING-INFO HANDLING**: For key information that can be asked about later (specifically **battery cycle count** and **repair/crash history**), if it is completely missing, the status should be `NEEDS_MANUAL_CHECK`, which **does not directly lead to rejection**. If the seller's persona is excellent, a "conditional recommendation" can be made.

### **Part Two: Detailed Analysis Guide**

**A. Product Itself Assessment (Criteria Analysis):**

1.  **Model & Package (`model_package`)**: Verify all text and images. If not a Mini 3 Pro or not a Fly More Combo (or equivalent accessories), then `FAIL`.
2.  **Battery Cycles (`battery_cycles`)**: Cycle count for a single battery ≤ 50. If no information, then `NEEDS_MANUAL_CHECK`.
3.  **Condition & Appearance (`condition`)**: At most, "light signs of use" are acceptable. Carefully inspect the drone body, arms, propellers, and gimbal in the pictures.
4.  **[V6.4 Logic Correction] Machine History (`history`)**: Strictly review all text and images for negative descriptions like "crashed," "repaired," "replaced," "water damaged," "gimbal not normal." **If not mentioned at all, the status is `NEEDS_MANUAL_CHECK`**; if there is any evidence of a crash or disassembly, it is a `FAIL`.

**B. Seller and Market Assessment (Core)**

5.  **In-depth Seller Background Analysis (`seller_type`) - [Decisive Evaluation]**:
    *   **Core Objective**: Use the "Persona-First Principle" to determine if the seller is a [Personal Player] or a [Merchant/Reseller].
    *   **[V6.3 Upgrade] Red Flag List & Exemption Clauses**:
        *   **Transaction Frequency**: Dense transactions in a short period.
            *   **[Enthusiast Exemption Clause]**: If the transaction records span a long period (e.g., over 2 years) and the buying/selling behavior forms a logical loop of "experience-upgrade-sell" (e.g., has played with FPV, Mavic, or other models), this clause does not apply. It is normal for a long-term aerial photography enthusiast to have dozens of transactions over several years.
        *   **Product Verticality**: The listed items are highly concentrated in a specific model or category.
            *   **[Enthusiast Exemption Clause]**: If the seller is a deep player in the field (as can be seen from their purchase history, reviews, and comments), focusing on drones is a reflection of their expertise. The key is to see if they are "playing" or "shipping goods."
        *   **"Jargon"**: Descriptions include terms like "recycle," "peers," "workshop," "trade-in," "bulk."
            *   **[No Exemption]**: This is a strong signal of a merchant.
        *   **Material Purchases**: Purchase history includes bulk batteries, propellers, repair tools, crashed drones, etc.
            *   **[No Exemption]**: This is decisive evidence of a merchant.
        *   **Image/Title Style**: Highly uniform, professional backgrounds in images; or templated titles.
            *   **[Enthusiast Exemption Clause]**: If the seller pursues perfection and has a fixed shooting corner to display their beloved drone, this is a plus. The key is whether the pictures convey a sense of "cherishing" or "merchandise."

6.  **Shipping Method (`shipping`)**: Explicitly stating "local pickup only" is a `FAIL`.
7.  **Seller Credit (`seller_credit`)**: `Seller Credit Level` must be **'Excellent'**.
